# library_management_system
 This Library Management System is a web-based application designed to streamline library operations by providing an admin interface for managing books and member profiles, and a member interface for accessing library resources. It includes features such as book management (add, edit, delete), user authentication (login/logout), and CRUD operations for both books and members. Built using PHP for the backend, MySQL for database management, and HTML/CSS for the frontend, this project offers a responsive and user-friendly interface for both administrators and library members.
